Welcome to SaSii's documentation!
===================================

**SaSii** is a R script for estimating genetic parameters from genotypic data for 
inferring sample size effects on genetic analysis. Applications of this package include 
planning the number of samples necessary to obtain robust population genetic estimates 
and evaluating if obtained sample size is large enough. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
